#### expense calculator 2021 <https://youtu.be/4LauocYqNyI>
I used two CSS files. One of them is for login and register and the other one is for budget design files. I wanna create separate those files because i
thought it will be less complicated for me. in the js folder, I added my budget.js Which will help me in my budget page which is the home page in the folders.
I added an event to the button and others (edit and delete function)
in my js codes, I wanna add the budget price and show that price on the other site, add my expenses, and show on the other side and at the end.
I wrote code that calculates budget and expense and shows in the balance. I also wrote codes that don't let me pass the text boxes blank and
if we do then it shows us an error message.
for templates file I used HTML. I created my HTML files. Used basic HTML codes little flask like importing IMG or importing CSS files.
for app.py first, I imported my requirements for the flask and others and I created my db.sql and with help of the terminal I created a database.DB after that I execute in app.py
later on i gave a route for my pages for example /login, /home, /register, /logout.
I CAN EASILY ADD MY BUDGET AND EXPENSES. THIS WEB APP CALCULATES EXPENSES EASILY AND ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO LOG IN AND REGISTER THE WEB APP.
also in my app.py, I check the database if its working or not if it's working then I can continue if it is not it gave me an error.
after checking the database continue with adding values from the form to our database with their username and password.
after on create my route for my index page and I render this as login.html. So every time I call "/" my login page will come to my page automatically.
after that, I created a registration route that help me to get a username and password from the form and send it to my database. But before that, I checked if my page is posted or get.
with that, I checked if the user left the username and password blank. if they did then I send them to the /home page.
if it's not blank then my values can be executed in the database and later register form will redirect to my login page
I will put the username and password that I used in the registration form and it will allow me to log in.
after I log in than I saw the main home page with my main program which is the expenses calculator without logging if we go to the home page it won't show us the calculator.
also, create a logout button that can end up the session and clear everything.
