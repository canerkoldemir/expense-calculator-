#### used two css file.One of them for login and register and the other one for budget design file.I wanna to create seprate those files because i
#### thought it will be less complicated for me.in js folder i added my budget.js This will help me in my budget page which is home page in the folders.
#### I added event to the button and others (edit and delete function)
#### in my js codes i wanna to add budget price and show that price on the other site, add my expenses and show on the other side and at the end.
#### i wrote code that calculate budget and expense and show in the balance. I also wrote codes that dont let me pass the textboxes blank and
#### if we do than it show us a error message.

#### for templates file i used html. i created my html files.Used basic html codes little flask like importing img or importing css files.
#### for app.py first i imported my requirements for the flask and others and i created my db.sql and with help of terminal i created database.db after that i execute in app.py
#### later on i gave a route for my pages for example /login, /home, /register, /logout.
#### I CAN EASILY ADD MY BUDGET AND EXPENSES. THIS WEB APP CALCULATES EXPENSES EASILY AND ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO LOG IN AND REGISTER THE WEB APP.
#### also in my app.py i check the database if its working or not if its working than i can continue if its not its gave me an error.
#### after checked the database continue with adding values from form to our database with their username and password.
#### after on create my route for my index page and i render this as login.html. So everytime i call "/" my login page will come to my page automatically.
#### after that i created registration route that help me to get username and password from form and send it to the my database.But before that i checked if my page is post or get.
#### with that i checked if the user left the username and password blank. if they did than i send the to the /home page.
#### if its not blank than my values can be execute in the database and later register form will redirect to me login page
#### i will put the username and password that i used in registration form and it will allow me to login.
#### after i loggin than i saw main home page with my main program which is expenses calculator without loggin if we go to the home page it wont show us the calculator.
#### also create logout button that can end up the session and clear everything.
